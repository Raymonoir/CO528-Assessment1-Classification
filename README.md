An Introduction to Artificial Intelligence assignment to implement a genetic algorithm to classify data collected from alchoholic study participants.

<h1> Aim of assessment </h1>
This assignment was set as a part of our Introduction to Artificial Intelligence module. This was used to test our ability to write a classification genetic algorithm that decides if neurological data collected is related to an alchohlic or non-alchoholic. We were required for our algorithm to reach a required accuracy on training data and out grade was decided depending on our accuracy on test data.
